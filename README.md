# **Face Recognition System using ArcFace**

## **Project Overview**

This project implements a **Face Recognition System** using Python, OpenCV, and DeepFace. It leverages the **ArcFace model** to generate **512-dimensional embeddings** for each face and recognizes people by comparing embeddings using **cosine similarity**.

The system can:

- Detect faces in images using OpenCV  
- Extract face embeddings using ArcFace  
- Recognize known individuals efficiently  
- Store embeddings and labels for quick lookup  
- Optional: Interactive demo using Gradio

## **Dataset**

The dataset folder `Peoples/` contains images of individuals organized by name.
